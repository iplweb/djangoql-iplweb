"""Explain *why* a DjangoQL query returns zero rows.

When a multi-condition query matches nothing, this module walks the validated
AST and counts the base queryset filtered by each sub-expression, then points
at the node(s) where the result collapses to zero:

- a leaf (single comparison) reports how many rows match it on its own;
- an ``AND`` whose two sides are each non-empty but whose intersection is zero
  is flagged as a *killer intersection* (``role == 'killer_and'``); an ``AND``
  that drops to zero because one side is already zero is still flagged
  ``killer_and`` (it is where the data runs out);
- an ``OR`` is zero only when *both* branches are zero — those branches are
  flagged ``dead_or_branch``; a zero branch of an otherwise non-empty ``OR`` is
  likewise flagged ``dead_or_branch`` so the user sees the part that never
  contributes.

The whole thing is lazy: :func:`explain_empty` returns ``None`` unless there is
an active search *and* the overall result is empty. A configurable
``max_nodes`` budget guards the (one ``count()`` per node) cost; an AST larger
than the budget is evaluated only down to its top-level conjuncts and the
returned tree carries ``truncated=True`` (no silent cap).
