0.20.0
------

* First release of the ``djangoql-iplweb`` fork (the import name is still
  ``djangoql``).
* **Breaking:** dropped support for Python older than 3.10 and Django older
  than 5.2. This release targets Python 3.10–3.14 and Django 5.2 LTS / 6.0.
  Projects running older Python or Django should use the upstream ``djangoql``
  package (0.19.x) instead.
* Add internationalization (i18n) support for user-facing error messages
  produced by the lexer, parser, schema validator and suggestions API.
  Ships translation catalogs for ``pl``, ``de``, ``fr``, ``es``, ``ru``,
  ``uk``, ``pt_BR``, ``it``, ``nl``, ``ja`` and ``zh_Hans``.
* Modernized packaging and developer tooling: migrated from
  ``setup.py``/``setup.cfg`` to ``pyproject.toml`` + uv, switched linting
  from flake8/isort to ruff, switched the test runner to pytest, and added
  bumpver for version management.
* Add opt-in **derived search fields** in ``djangoql.extras`` (enable via
  ``ExtrasSchema`` or by composing ``DatePartsSchemaMixin`` /
  ``AggregateSchemaMixin``):

  * Date/time parts for ``DateField`` / ``DateTimeField`` / ``TimeField``,
    e.g. ``written__year >= 2020``, ``written__month in (6, 7, 8)``,
    ``written__hour < 9``, plus ``__date`` / ``__time`` extraction from
    ``DateTimeField``.
  * Relation aggregates computed as lazy, correlated subqueries:
    ``<rel>__count`` for every to-many relation and
    ``<rel>__<numeric_field>__{sum,avg,min,max}``. Aggregates are applied
    only when referenced in a query and work in both the admin and the
    queryset API.
* Add a ``suggested`` flag to ``DjangoQLField`` (default ``True``) to control
  whether a field appears in autocomplete suggestions, independent of value
  suggestions (``suggest_options``).
* Test suite can now run against PostgreSQL via testcontainers
  (``DJANGOQL_TEST_DB=postgres``); CI exercises both SQLite and PostgreSQL.

* fixed regression for Django < 2.1 (thanks to @derekenos for reporting the
  issue);

0.15.1
------

* fixed ``url()`` deprecation warnings for Django 3.1+ (thanks to @ecilveks);

0.15.0
------

* the completion JavaScript widget has been moved to
  `its own repo <https://github.com/ivelum/djangoql-completion>`_ and is now
  available as a standalone
  `package on npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/djangoql-completion>`_. It
  still ships with the Python package, though, so if you don't need to embed
  the completion widget in your custom JavaScript application, no additional
  installation steps are required;
* added support for GenericIPAddressField (thanks to @HannaShalamitskaya for
  reporting the issue);
* the source code is now linted with flake8 and isort;

0.14.5
------

0.14.4
------

* add ``~`` operator for date/datetime fields;

0.14.3
------

  change prevents an error that may arise if DjangoQL is installed into

* fixed quotes handling in completion widget (#62, thanks to @nicolazilio for
  reporting this);

  to the test matrix);

0.14.0
------

* New feature: field suggestion options are now loaded asynchronously via
  Suggestions API;
* **Breaking**: ``DjangoQLField.get_options()`` now accepts mandatory ``search``
  parameter. If you've implemented custom suggestion options for your schema,
  please add handling of this parameter (you should only return results that
  match ``search`` criteria);
* **Breaking**: when using in the admin together with the standard Django
  search, DjangoQL checkbox is now on by default. If you don't want this
  behavior, you can turn it off with ``djangoql_completion_enabled_by_default``
  option. Thanks to @nicolazilio for the idea;
* Deprecated: if you've used ``DjangoQLSchema.as_dict()`` somewhere in your
  code, please switch to new schema serializers instead (see in
  ``serializers.py``);
* Improved field customization examples in the docs (#55, thanks to
  @joeydebreuk);
