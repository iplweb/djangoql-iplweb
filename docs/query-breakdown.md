# Query breakdown — record counts per branch

How many rows does each part of a query match? For
`genre = 1 and rating = 5`, you might want to see that `genre = 1` matches 100
rows, `rating = 5` matches 100 rows, but together they match only 2 — and *which*
branch is the one that collapses the result.

DjangoQL can compute that breakdown by walking the validated AST and running one
`count()` per sub-expression.

This is the **on-demand** sibling of the
[empty-result breakdown](empty-result-breakdown.md): the empty-result version
fires automatically (and only) when a search returns zero rows, while the
breakdown here runs whenever you ask for it, for *any* query, empty or not.

## Library primitive: `explain`

```python
from djangoql.breakdown import explain

tree = explain(Book.objects.all(), 'genre = 1 and rating = 5')
```

`tree` is a nested dict:

```python
{
    'text': 'genre = 1 and rating = 5',  # the sub-expression (from the AST)
    'count': 2,                           # rows matching this sub-expression
    'role': 'and',                        # 'leaf' | 'and' | 'or' | …
    'children': [
        {'text': 'genre = 1',  'count': 100, 'role': 'leaf', 'children': []},
        {'text': 'rating = 5', 'count': 100, 'role': 'leaf', 'children': []},
    ],
}
```

Roles flag interesting nodes: an `and` that collapses to zero is `killer_and`;
a zero branch of an `or` is `dead_or_branch`. `explain` returns `None` for an
empty query.

### Cost

`explain` runs **one `count()` per AST node** — potentially expensive on large
tables. Two guards:

- It is **caller-triggered**: nothing runs it implicitly per search. You invoke
  it (or the user clicks a button) when a breakdown is actually wanted.
- The `max_nodes` budget (default `50`) caps how many nodes are counted; a
  larger query is counted only down to its top-level conjuncts and the tree
  carries `truncated=True` (no silent cap).

```python
explain(qs, search, max_nodes=10)
```

## Admin endpoint

`DjangoQLSearchMixin` exposes an `…/explain/` endpoint (URL name
`<app>_<model>_djangoql_explain`). It accepts the raw query as `q` (GET or POST)
and returns the tree as JSON:

```json
{ "tree": { "text": "genre = 1", "count": 100, "role": "leaf", "children": [] } }
```

`tree` is `null` for an empty query; an invalid query returns `{"error": "..."}`
with HTTP 400. It counts against `get_queryset(request)` and honours
`djangoql_explain_empty_max_nodes` as the `max_nodes` budget.

!!! note "Triggering and rendering are your decision"
    The endpoint is on-demand by design — it is **not** called on every search,
    because of the per-node `count()` cost. Whether you wire it to a button, a
    hover, or a toggle, and how you render the tree (a panel, a tooltip, inline
    badges) is the integrator's choice. The `example_project/` shows one
    reference: a toggle that fetches the tree and renders it as an expandable
    list with per-branch counts.
